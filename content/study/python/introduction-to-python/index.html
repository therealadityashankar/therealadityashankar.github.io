    here's a little secret to learning programming, if you truly
    want to learn to be an expert, fall in love with the language,
    try to do stuff not because you were taught that, but because its cool,

    ## lets create a simple question answer service !

    ### printing

    firstly, introduction to the `print` function,

    the print function, when used with 'strings' or 'numbers', simply
    prints the output, we'll learn more in depth about these data-types
    in the future
  </script>
</wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python">
  <script type="wc-content">
    print("Hello !, what is your name ?")
  </script>
</wc-code>

    ### variables and inputs !

    but wait !, thats just a question, how do we receive answers too ?,

    **new concept**: the input function !

    welcome, the `input` function !

    the `input` function simply asks the user for text, then returns the
    entered text

    **new concept**: variables !

    a variable in python is a place where you can store values !
    
    try out the code below !
  </script>
</wc-markdown>


<wc-code mode="python">
  <script type="wc-content">
    print("Hello !, what is your name ?")
    name = input("enter your name here !")
    print("Hi " + name + "!")
  </script>
</wc-code>

    what did we just do up there with the `+` symbol ?

    well, we added them, when 2 strings in python are added with
    the `+` operator, they combine and turn into 1 string.
    wow, nice !

    ### numbers

    now, here is a something I want anyone seeing this program to know,

    I want them to know that `3` is my favourite number
    although, it changes on a daily basis, cause I'm like that,

    so I don't want to directly print it, and make it easy to update !
  </script>
</wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python">
  <script type="wc-content">
    favourite_number = 3
    print("Hello !, what is your name ?")
    name = input("enter your name here !")
    print("Hi " + name + "!")
    print("My favourite number is " + favourite_number)
  </script>
</wc-code>

    ### converting from a number to a string
    oh no !, why did that throw an Error ?,

    well python does not allow you to add "Strings" and "Numbers",

    okay, I guess we didn't formally define the data types

    A string is essentially a group a characters, we define strings via
    starting and ending with `"` or `'` characters,

    for example: `"Aditya Shankar"`, `'Python'`, `"Hello !, what is your name ?"` are strings !

    A number is a, well number, such as `31212`, or `21` or `6.32`

    now, python does not allow you to add strings and numbers, so, now,

    we have to convert the number into a string, and we can do this via
    the `str()` function
  </script>
</wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python">
  <script type="wc-content">
    favourite_number = 3
    print("Hello whats your name ?")
    name = input("enter your name here !")
    print("Hi " + name + "!")
    print("My favourite number is " + str(favourite_number))
  </script>
</wc-code>

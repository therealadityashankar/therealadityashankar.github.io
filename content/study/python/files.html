# the open function !

python's super simple open function allows us to read/write files very very easily, this module also aims to be a simple self learning session.

**Question**

```
1. create a file "some_text.txt" in a directory, add some random text in this file, ensure you atleast write 50 characters of text (50 letters)
2. in the same directory download and add the file below, the run the python code
try the code below:
```
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
file = open("some_text.txt")
text = file.read()
print(text)

# it is good practice to always call the .close() function
file.close()
</script></wc-code>

## the with function

we will not be getting in depth with the `with` function, but it essentially is the recommended way of interacting with files, as we may forget to write the `.close()` function

below: a better alternative to the previous code
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_text.txt") as file:
    text = file.read()
    print(text)
</script></wc-code>

## reading partially

sometimes we only want to read a part of the text, this has benefits including not dumping the whole thing unnecessarily in the RAM and slowing down the computer, this is especially useful for large files

try the code below
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_text.txt") as file:
    text = file.read(5)
    print(text)
    text = file.read(5)
    print(text)
</script></wc-code>

<wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
## going to a point and then reading

you can also go to a certain point and then read in the file
via file.seek()
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_text.txt") as file:
    file.seek(35)
    print(file.read(5))
</script></wc-code>

<wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
## writing to a file

you may also write to a file with a second 'w' parameter

NOTE : THIS CREATES A NEW FILE ! BE CAREFUL !
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_file.txt", 'w') as file:
    file.write("hi !")
</script></wc-code>

<wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
## reading and writing to a file

to write to an existing file you've to use the 'r+' second parameter

run the code and open the text file ou were working on !
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_text.txt", 'r+') as file:
    print(file.read())
    file.write("hi !")
</script></wc-code>

## checking for the existance of a file, then creating it

sometimes you want to create a file if it does not exist, you may do
that by using the os module in python

for example if your user is running the code for the first time, and
you need to create a supporting file for an app
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
import os.path

if not os.path.isfile("./some_text.txt"):
  with open("some_text.txt", 'w') as file:
      print(file.read())
      file.write("hi !")
</script></wc-code>

# the open function !

python's super simple open function allows us to read/write files very very easily, this module also aims to be a simple self learning session.

**Question**

```
1. create a file "some_text.txt" in a directory, add some random text in this file, ensure you atleast write 50 characters of text (50 letters)
2. in the same directory download and add the file below, the run the python code
try the code below:
```
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
file = open("some_text.txt")
text = file.read()
print(text)

# it is good practice to always call the .close() function
file.close()
</script></wc-code>

## the with function

we will not be getting in depth with the `with` function, but it essentially is the recommended way of interacting with files, as we may forget to write the `.close()` function

below: a better alternative to the previous code
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_text.txt") as file:
    text = file.read()
    print(text)
</script></wc-code>

## reading partially

sometimes we only want to read a part of the text, this has benefits including not dumping the whole thing unnecessarily in the RAM and slowing down the computer, this is especially useful for large files

try the code below
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
with open("some_text.txt") as file:
    text = file.read(5)
    print(text)
    text = file.read(5)
    print(text)
</script></wc-code>

      # advanced loops

      we're going to talk about

      - break statements
      - continue statements
      - list comprihension
      - nested loops
      - for else loops

      ## break statements

      another way to break out of loops is via the
      break statement

      try the code below
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      i = 0

      while True:
          if i >= 5:
              break

          print(i)

          i += 1
  </script></wc-code>

  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      # continue statement

      the continue statement allows you to "skip" the rest of
      certain code in a for loop,

      try out the example below
  </script></wc-markdown>
  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      stocks = ["ABC", "DEF", "GHI", "JKL", "MNO", "PQR", "STU", "VWX"]
      stock_prices = [99, 123, 231, 333, 222, 211, 413, 123, ]

      for i in range(len(stocks)):
          stock = stocks[i]
          stock_price = stock_prices[i]

          if stock_price < 200:
              continue

          print(f"check out stock {stock} at {stock_price}")
  </script></wc-code>

  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      # list comprihension

      sometimes our operations are really small and
      we don't really need big loops for them

      try out the code below:
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      # simple example
      a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
      print(a)

      b = [i**2 for i in a]
      print(b)

      c = [i**2 for i in a if i > 3]
      print(c)
  </script></wc-code>

  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      # nested loops

      loops can also go inside other loops, these have
      various purposes, here is a huge example
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      a = [[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]]

      for l in a:
          for num in l:
            print(f"from list : {l}")
  </script></wc-code>

  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      # for-else loops

      ok, this is a little interesting,

      try the code below
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
      min_num = 4

      for i in a:
          if i > min_num:
              print(f"has num greater than {min_num}")
              break
      else: # executes if the break statement is never called
          print(f"has no num greater than {min_num}")


      min_num = 9

      for i in a:
          if i > min_num:
              print(f"has num greater than {min_num}")
              break
      else: # executes if the break statement is never called
          print(f"has no num greater than {min_num}")
  </script></wc-code>

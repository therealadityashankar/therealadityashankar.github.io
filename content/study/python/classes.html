# classes and object oriented programming

remember when we wrote stocks and stock prices in the previous exercise

and we have 2 lists and accessing list data became so difficult, further this becomes even worse with many stock items 

consider the following, lets have the data of a few stocks

```python
stocks = ["THYROCARE", "RELIANCE", "TTM", "AUBANK", "MMM", "S&P", "APPL"]
stocks_open = [100.11, 200.2, 180.1, 111.33, 444.1, 122.7, 100.33]
stocks_adj_close = [100.1, 200.1, 160.2, 120.00, 422.44, 111.3, 90.1]
stocks_high = [110.2, 205.3, 190.3, 150.5, 455.1, 135.2, 110.2] 
stocks_low = [95.5, 190.3, 170.3, 111.33, 440.2, 110.4, 90.4]
```

**Question [try yourself first]**
```
- get the index of the stock for RELIANCE, then
- access the stock data for RELIANCE, print its open, adjclose, high and low data
```

but this is a very uncomfortable way to code, what we could alternatively
do is create a stocks object class

**Question**
```
- create a stock object class
- create a RELIANCE stock
- add high, low, adjclose, and open values to it
- print values from it
```
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
class Stock:
  "A simple stock class"
  def __init__(self, name, high, open, low, adjclose):
      self.name = name
      self.high = high
      self.low = low
      self.open = open
      self.adjclose = adjclose

stock = Stock(name="RELIANCE",
              high=200.02, 
              open=200.1, 
              low=190.3, 
              adjclose=170.3)

print(f"RELIANCE: open: {stock.open}, adj close: {stock.adjclose}, high : {stock.high}, low: {stock.low}")

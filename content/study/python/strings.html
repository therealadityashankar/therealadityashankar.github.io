      # Strings

      every programming language has some form or ability to allow you to insert text input, so does python

      ### some string examples

      some string examples include

      `'Python'`, `"Aditya Shankar"`, `'Jasmine'`, `"Jasmine's house"`

      we can use the print() function to print stuff

      ## Basic string building

      strings may start with single-quotes `'` or double-quotes `"` and have to end with the same type of quote they started with

      ## string escaping

      one of the obvious thing you may ask with the above task is how would you add a single-quote or a double-quote to a string, that is created using the same notation?

      well, you use string escaping !

      for putting the same start-end value, we use "\" + the quote used

      for eg: `'Alex\'s grammer mistakes'`, `"he said \"I don't like this\""`
  </script></wc-markdown>
  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      language = "python" # start and end with double-quotes
      game = 'football' # or single-quotes

      # to have the string start/end quote in the string
      # use string escaping, i.e. "\" + quote
      print('Alex\'s grammer mistakes')
      print("he said \"I don't like this\"")

      print(language)
      print(game)
      print('some text')
      print("some text")
  </script></wc-code>
  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      string escaping also allows one to add special characters in the string, such as newlines (with `"\n"`), tabs (with `"\t"`), backslash (with `"\\"`)

      for eg: `'I like chocolate\nHe likes cake'`, `'this is a slash - \\'`
  </script></wc-markdown>
  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      language = "python" # start and end with double-quotes
      game = 'football' # or single-quotes

      # to have the string start/end quote in the string
      # use string escaping, i.e. "\" + quote
      print('Alex\'s grammer mistakes')
      print("he said \"I don't like this\"")

      # you can use newlines via '\n' in code
      print('I like chocolate\nHe likes cake')

      # you can print a "\" by putting 2 slashes
      print('this is a slash - \\')

      print(language)
      print(game)
      print('some text')
      print("some text")

      ## triple quoted strings

      you may also choose to start strings via triple quotes `"""` and `'''`, the advantage of these are that these can contain multiline texts,

      ```
      print("""abc, def, 
      ghi, jkl,
      mno""")
      ```

      so, try,

      language = "python" # start and end with double-quotes
      game = 'football' # or single-quotes

      # to have the string start/end quote in the string
      # use string escaping, i.e. "\" + quote
      print('Alex\'s grammer mistakes')
      print("he said \"I don't like this\"")

      # you can use newlines via '\n' in code
      print('I like chocolate\nHe likes cake')

      # you can print a "\" by putting 2 slashes
      print('this is a slash - \\')

      # triple quoted strings allow you to add slashes directly
      print("""abc, def, 
      ghi, jkl,
      mno""")

      print(language)
      print(game)
      print('some text')
      print("some text")

      ## r-strings

      there are some cases where string escaping makes things tougher and not easier, if, for example you need to add the literal term \n, or you need many backslashes,

      r-strings don't follow escaping rules and come in plainly

      **the only catch is that you cannot print single slashes via r-strings**

      try: `print(r"abc\\d")`

      ## string formatting

      ### f-strings

      the best way to format strings in python is via `f-strings` in python

      f-strings allow easy string interpolation

      here is a basic example

      ```python
      name = "Avnish"
      age = 29

      print(f"Hi my name is {name}, and my age is {age}")
      ```
  </script></wc-markdown>
  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      language = "python" # start and end with double-quotes
      game = 'football' # or single-quotes

      print(f"my favourite language is {language} and my favourite game is {game}")
  </script></wc-code>
  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      essentially all content inside is converted and formatted accordingly

      you may also have numeric formatting in f-strings via `f'result: {value:{width}.{precision}}'`

      for example, try: `print(f"result : {42:2.5f})"`

      heres a fuller example:

      ```python
      value = 413223.123123312

      print(f"value: {value:.2f}")
      ```
  </script></wc-markdown>
  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      language = "python" # start and end with double-quotes
      game = 'football' # or single-quotes
      favourite_number = 19
      pi = 3.1415926535

      print(f"my favourite language is {language} and my favourite game is {game}")
      print("my favourite number is {favourite_number}")

      # you can also format numbers in python
      print(f"pi is {pi:.2f}")
  </script></wc-code>
  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      ### str.format is also another method to format strings

      `print("I have {} apples, and they're really nice".format(69))`
  </script></wc-markdown>
  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      print("I have {} apples, and they're really nice".format(69))
  </script></wc-code>

      ## string accessing and length

      you may get string indexes the same way list values are accessable

      try:
      ```
      a = "hello people"

      print(a[0])
      print(a[4])
      ```

      string lengths may also be accessed via the `len()` function

      try:
      ```
      print(len("123456"))
      ```

      strings are also iterable

      try:
      ```
      for l in "123456":
          print(l)
      ```

      string lengths may also be accessed via the `len()` function

      try:
      ```
      print(len("123456"))
      ```

      strings are also iterable

      try:
      ```
      for l in "123456":
          print(l)
      ```
    </script>
  </wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      str_len = len("abcdef")
      print(str_len)

      name = "Aditya Shankar"
      print(len(name))

      # remember
      # strings are 0-indexed, that means the
      # first character is at 0 not 1 !
      print(name[0])
      print(name[5])


      # We'll learn more about loops later, do not worry about it now !
      for l in name:
          print(l)

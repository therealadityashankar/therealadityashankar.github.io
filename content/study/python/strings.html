      # Strings

      every programming language has some form or ability to allow you to insert text input, so does python

      ### some string examples

      some string examples include

      `'Python'`, `"Aditya Shankar"`, `'Jasmine'`, `"Jasmine's house"`

      ## Basic string building

      strings may start with single-quotes `'` or double-quotes `"` and have to end with the same type of quote they started with

      ## string escaping

      one of the obvious thing you may ask with the above task is how would you add a single-quote or a double-quote to a string, that is created using the same notation?

      well, you use string escaping !

      for eg: `'Alex\'s grammer mistakes'`, `"he said \"I don't like this\""`

      string escaping also allows one to add special characters in the string, such as newlines (with "\n"), tabs (with "\t"), backslash (with "\\")

      for eg: `'I like chocolate\nHe likes cake'`, `'this is a slash - \\'`

      ## triple quoted strings

      you may also choose to start strings via triple quotes `"""` and `'''`, the advantage of these are that these can contain multiline texts,

      so, try, 

      ```
      """
      print("""abc, def, 
      ghi, jkl,
      mno""")
      """
      ```

      these are generally put in the start of documents and function definitions to show what the file does 

      ## r-strings

      there are some cases where string escaping makes things tougher and not easier, if, for example you need to add the literal term \n, or you need many backslashes,

      r-strings don't follow escaping rules and come in plainly

      try: `print(r"abc\\d")`

      ## string formatting

      ### f-strings

      the best way to format strings in python is via `f-strings` in python

      f-strings allow easy string interpolation

      here is a basic example

      ```python
      name = "Avnish"
      age = 29

      print(f"Hi my name is {name}, and my age is {age}")
      ```

      essentially all content inside is converted and formatted accordingly

      you may also have numeric formatting in f-strings via `f'result: {value:{width}.{precision}}'`

      for example, try: `print(f"result : {42:2.5f})"`

      heres a fuller example:

      ```python
      value = 413223.123123312

      print(f"value: {value:.2f}")
      ```

      ### str.format is also another method to format strings

      `print("I have {} apples, and they're really nice".format(69))`

      ## string accessing and length

      you may get string indexes the same way list values are accessable

      try:
      ```
      a = "hello people"

      print(a[0])
      print(a[4])
      ```

      string lengths may also be accessed via the `len()` function

      try:
      ```
      print(len("123456"))
      ```

      strings are also iterable

      try:
      ```
      for l in "123456":
          print(l)
      ```

      # for loops

      so, we have been introduced to lists, and if you've prior
      programming knowledge, you'd know about loops

      python has 2 kinds of loops, the for loop and the while loop

      try out : 
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
          print(i)
  </script></wc-code>

  <wc-markdown><script type="wc-content">
      now, pythonic loops are different from loops in other languages,
      as in they go over lists instead of using numeric comparisions and 
      a number, loops also go over iterators, but we'll do a deep dive
      into those later

      one think you may have noticed is it is very inefficient to type
      all the numbers we need to go through (any may not always be
      possible)

      there in comes the `range` function !

      try out :
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      for i in range(6):
          print(i)
  </script></wc-code>

  <wc-markdown mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      the range function supports 1 to 3 arguments, if one argument is
      supplied (like above), the loop will loop through all numbers from
      0 -> your supplied number

      also try out :
  </script></wc-markdown>

  <wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
      # 2 arguments
      print("range with 2 arguments")

      for i in range(1, 6):
          print(f"numero : {i}")

      # 3 arguments
      print("range with 3 arguments")

      for i in range(0, 6, 2):
          print(f"numero : {i}")
  </script></wc-code>

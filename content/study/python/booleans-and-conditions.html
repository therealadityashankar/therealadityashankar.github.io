    # booleans, comparisions and conditions

    lets do a few number comparisions, run the code snippets below
</script></wc-markdown>

<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
    num_1 = 10
    num_2 = 213412
    num_3 = 131241
    num_4 = 1233222
    num_5 = 5555
    num_6 = 5555

    if num_1 > num_2:
        print("num_1 is greater")
    else:
        print("num_2 is greater")

    # comparisions can also be stored !
    num3_less_than_num4 = num_3 <= num_4

    if num3_less_than_num4: 
        print("num_3 is less than num_4")

    if num_5 == num_6: print("num_5 and num_6 are equal !")

    if num_5 == num_6 and num1 > num2:
        print("booyah !")

    if num_5 == num_6 or num1 < num2:
        print("heya !")
</script></wc-code>

    ## basic comparision operators: 
    - `>` : greater than, checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right
    - `<` : less than, checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right
    - `>=` : less than or equal to, checks if the number on the left is less or equal to than the number on the right
    - `<=` : greater than or equal to, checks if the number on the left is greater or equal to than the number on the right
    - `==` : equality check, checks if both numbers are equal
    - `and` : checks if the condition of the right and left are true
    - `or` : checks if the condition on the right or left is true


    ## examples of comparisions and loops

    say we've a bunch of stocks and we only want the stocks whose value is greater than a certain
    amount, well, here is how we can check for stocks valued greater than a certain amount
</script></wc-markdown>


<wc-code mode="python"><script type="wc-content">
    stocks = ["AAP", "BBP", "CARL", "MNOP", "QRS", "TUV", "MMM"]
    stock_prices = [12, 123, 500, 312, 131, 111, 301]
    min_stock_price = 200
    good_stocks = []

    for i in range(len(stocks)):
        stock = stocks[i]
        stock_price = stock_prices[i]

        if stock_price >= min_stock_price:
            good_stocks.append(stock)

    print(f"earlier stocks : {stocks}")
    print(f"good stocks : {good_stocks}")
</script></wc-code>

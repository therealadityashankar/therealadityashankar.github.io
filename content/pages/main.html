    Hi there !, 

    I was born on the 21'st of april 2001, (and I'm really glad I did that),

    I wish I could tell you more about that day, but to be honest, I really don't remember much about it

    personally, what I can tell you about myself is this, 

    I love making stuff from scratch, tearing stuff apart, putting it back together just to see how it works, I find learning stuff quite exciting and interesting, 
    
    I love to spend long hours writing code, or making inventions, it kinda just flows in my blood to do that, 

    apart from this, I love taking long walks, going in hikes, or exploring new areas

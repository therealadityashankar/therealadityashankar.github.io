# how i code

- primary editor : vim

my philosophy:, super-easy maintainability

when I code, I think of 2 primary things,

- its use
- I'm going to have to maintain this 5 years from now, how do I make that a breeze for future me ?, how can I reduce my headache to the maximum

I'm typing this because the nodejs toolchain is so massive, its quite frustrating, consider the massive amount of software whose goal is to do the same thing, but they're so frustrating, to learn

for bundling alone, there's a crazy ton of software, there's
- rollup
- browserify
- esmtk
- webpack
- microbundle
- parcel


then there is another field for automated taskrunners
- gulp
- grunt


and then each bundler has plugins you need to learn about, like typescript plugins, or coffeescript plugins, or something like that, 

and then you've to maintain a seperate config file (or config options for everything)

and while I may find those concepts interesting today, in the future there are going to be completely different pieces of popular software that would be more interesting,

I guess what I wanna do is keep it tiny, really small and simple and tested, I don't frustrate future Aditya Shankar, I wanna make like really easy for him, make sure he does not feel overwhelmed by everything
